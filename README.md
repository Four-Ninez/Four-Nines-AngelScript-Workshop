# Note
I'm totally noob at scripting, so codelines sometimes are totally mess. Don't judge too harshly.

# AngelScript Workshop
A Sven Co-op weapon scripts for my server and maps. 

For newbies: if you want to use it as a server plugin, type this in default_plugins.txt:

 	"plugin"
	{
		"name" "Four-Nines Custom Weapons"
		"script" "custom_weapons-fnz"
	}

Next, you will have to enter the items/weapons yourself somehow in BuyMenu (e.g. Ecco), or spawn it via the “Give” command


If you want to test this quickly, check this https://github.com/Four-Ninez/TestMap

Also, if you want more weapons or have any ideas of what else to add, dm me in my Discord: fournines

W.I.P.
